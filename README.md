# Nilesh Sharma

Software Engineering student focused on **problem solving, backend systems, and clean architecture**.

I prefer building **fewer, well-thought-out projects** rather than many shallow ones.  
Currently strengthening fundamentals in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Backend Development**.

---

## Focus Areas

- Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)
- Backend development with Node.js & Express
- REST API design and authentication
- Understanding how real production systems work

---

## Tech Stack

**Languages**  
C++, JavaScript

**Backend**  
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

**Frontend**  
React, HTML, CSS

**Tools**  
Git, GitHub, Postman

---

## Projects

**MockX**  
A full-stack web application built with a backend-first approach.  
Emphasis on API design, authentication flows, and maintainable structure.

(More improvements and refactoring in progress.)

---

## Current Direction

- Daily DSA practice
- Writing cleaner, more readable code
- Learning system-level thinking instead of framework-level hacks
